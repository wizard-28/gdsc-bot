This file details my development process.

1. Created the base project using poetry and setted up the general python groundwork.
2. Evaluate various discord python libraries online like hikari, discord.py, interactions.py.
   Eventually settle on discord.py as it has the largest community.
3. Learn about the basic boilerplate from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYJDKSah-Ww>
4. Learn about slash commands etc from here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Sj5hJFqUs>
